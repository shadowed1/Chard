## Installer will fail to finish, and kick user out of shell. It will finish setting up chard environment though. 
### Semi - Functioning. Please do not install without a usb recovery as this is under rapid development and mistakes happen.   <br>
*Requires Developer Mode* <br>
*After install, enter shell, and chard commands will be available, along with many apps; like nano. 
`nano` <--- to launch nano.
